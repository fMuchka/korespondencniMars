# Mob Programming Workflow

**Real-time collaborative coding - you navigate, agent drives**

## Overview

Highest collaboration level where you and the agent work together in real-time:

- **You (Navigator)**: Guide the approach, make decisions
- **Agent (Driver)**: Write the code based on your guidance
- Continuous discussion and refinement

## Ratings

- **Collaboration Level**: Very High
- **Learning Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Speed**: Slow (but thorough)

## When to Use

✅ **Best for:** Complex problems, architectural decisions, learning new concepts  
❌ **Not ideal for:** Simple tasks, time-sensitive work

## Flow

```
You: "Let's mob program the statistics feature"
Agent: "Great! You navigate, I'll drive. What's first?"

You: "Create a function to calculate win rate"
Agent: [writes function signature]
Agent: "Like this?"

You: "Yes, now add the calculation logic"
Agent: [implements]
Agent: "Should we handle the zero case?"

You: "Good catch! Add that check"
Agent: [adds check]

You: "Perfect! Now let's add tests..."
```

## Benefits
