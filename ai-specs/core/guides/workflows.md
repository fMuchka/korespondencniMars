## Workflows

### Standard Development

**Agent does everything, you review**

- **You**: Provide requirements
- **Agent**: Plan → Code → Test → Review
- **Best for**: Most features, quick delivery

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/standard-dev.md)** _(coming soon)_

---

### TDD (You Write Tests)

**You write tests first, agent implements**

- **You**: Write tests defining success
- **Agent**: Implement until tests pass
- **Best for**: Critical features, learning codebase

**Example:**

```
You write: test('calculates win rate correctly')
Agent implements: calculateWinRate() function
Tests pass ✅
```

---

### Reverse TDD

**Agent writes tests, you implement**

- **Agent**: Write failing tests
- **You**: Implement until tests pass
- **Best for**: Learning testing patterns, TDD methodology

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/reverse-tdd.md)**

---

### Tag-Team Development

**Alternate between testing and implementation**

- **Round 1**: You write test → Agent implements
- **Round 2**: Agent writes test → You implement
- **Repeat** until complete
- **Best for**: Balanced learning, high engagement

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/tag-team.md)**

---

### Solo Dev + Review

**You build everything, agent reviews**

- **You**: Write tests AND code
- **Agent**: Review for quality, standards, best practices
- **Best for**: Independent work, fast iteration

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/solo-dev-review.md)**

---

### Mob Programming

**Real-time collaborative coding**

- **You**: Navigate (guide approach)
- **Agent**: Drive (write code)
- **Together**: Discuss and refine
- **Best for**: Complex problems, architectural decisions

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/mob-programming.md)**

---

### Spike & Stabilize

**Prototype fast, refine later**

- **Phase 1**: You quickly prototype (messy OK)
- **Phase 2**: Agent refactors, adds tests, cleans up
- **Best for**: Exploring ideas, proof of concepts

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/spike-stabilize.md)**

---

### Design → Implement

**Specification-driven development**

- **You**: Write detailed specs/pseudocode
- **Agent**: Translate to code with tests
- **Best for**: Architecture learning, when you know WHAT not HOW

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/design-implement.md)**

---

### Parallel Development

**Work on separate features simultaneously**

- **You**: Work on Feature A
- **Agent**: Work on Feature B
- **Then**: Integrate and test together
- **Best for**: Independent features, maximum speed

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/parallel-dev.md)**

---

### Bug Hunt & Fix

**Collaborative debugging**

- **You**: Find bugs, write reproduction tests
- **Agent**: Fix bugs, ensure tests pass
- **Best for**: Debugging sessions, quality improvement

**[→ Detailed guide](./examples/bug-hunt-fix.md)**

---

### Documentation Only

**Planning and brainstorming**

- **You**: Share ideas and requirements
- **Agent**: Document in structured format
- **Together**: Discuss trade-offs
- **Best for**: Architecture decisions, planning sprints

**Example:**

```
You: "Thinking about adding multiplayer sessions"
Agent creates:
- Architecture document
- Technical considerations
- Implementation phases
- Risk assessment
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### General

1. **Mix and match** - Use different workflows for different tasks
2. **Start simple** - Try Standard or Solo Dev + Review first
3. **Communicate** - Tell the agent which workflow you want
4. **Iterate** - Adjust if it's not working
5. **Have fun** - Experiment and find what works!

### For You

- **Be specific** - Clear requirements = better results
- **Review early** - Catch issues before they compound
- **Write tests** - Best way to communicate intent
- **Ask questions** - Agent can explain decisions

### For Agent

- **Create task.md** - Keep work trackable
- **Update progress** - Mark items as you go
- **Follow workflow** - Respect the chosen pattern
- **Communicate blockers** - Ask when stuck

## 📋 Task File Format

All workflows use `ai-specs/current_task.md`:

```markdown
# [Task Name]

**Type:** Bug / Feature
**Status:** In Progress / Blocked / Complete
**Started:** 2025-12-09
**Workflow:** Standard / TDD / Reverse TDD / etc.

## Checklist

- [x] Completed item
- [/] In progress item
- [ ] Pending item

## Notes

- Important context
- Blockers or questions
```

---

**Ready to start?** Pick a workflow and tell the agent: "Let's use [workflow name] for this!" 🚀

## ✅ Definition of Done

For ANY workflow, a task is only considered complete when:

1.  **Code is implemented** and meets requirements.
2.  **Tests pass** (if applicable to the workflow).
3.  **Docs are updated** (README, system context, etc.).
4.  **`ai-specs/project/current_task.md` IS UPDATED** to reflect the completed status.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to update `current_task.md` leads to context loss. Update it **before** the final `notify_user` call.
